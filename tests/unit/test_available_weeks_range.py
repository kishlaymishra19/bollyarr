"""Tests for ISO-correct date ranges on the dashboard week list.

``get_available_weeks`` previously derived the week's Monday from naive
``date(year, 1, 1) + timedelta`` arithmetic, which disagreed with the ISO
calendar the week pages use. For 2021 W01 that rendered ``Dec 28 - Jan 03``
while the week page correctly rendered the Jan 04-10 range. The range now comes
from ``date.fromisocalendar`` so both views agree.
